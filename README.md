My own personal website. Yay!

This is the end-game scenario for all ongoig projects.
The interactive menu will ultimately lead to:
* bandcamp
* publications
* uploaded labs
* etc.

In the meantime, however, I am diverting my attention to make my portfolio the landing page for all business/job related purposes.

Survival first, then high art.
