    " The problem at hand is a two body gravitational problem in which the mass for which we are solving the system is much smaller than the mass it is being attracted to. Hence, based on Kepler’s Laws, we expect to see the trajectory of the particle to follow a closed ellipse. Moreover, from conservation laws we also expect that the total energy of the system and its angular momentum are conserved at each point in time. This behavior is obtained under the premise of analyticity—the idea that the time step for evaluation is infinitesimally small. A computer is unable to use infinitesimals, but we expect that as the step size gets smaller, the trajectory of the particle will more closely resemble an ellipse while the energy and angular momentum will vary less from the initial values."

    "In the case of the Euler method, the finite difference is obtained from a straight line approximation. This means that at larger step sizes, error will accumulate rapidly to the point that the trajectory of the body will fail to be a closed ellipse. Moreover, the conserved quantities will vary significantly due to the fact that the particle’s position is being approximated at discrete steps, which violates the time translational invariance and analyticity from which conservation laws are obtained. The first problem can be resolved by making the step size small enough that you get an $n$-sided polygon with sufficient sides that it resembles an ellipse. Making the step size smaller should also make the fluctuations in angular momentum and energy smaller, but will not be able to get rid of them completely. "

    "The Runge-Kutta method will exhibit behavior similar to the Euler method because it is derived from it. In the case of the 4th order method, however, the finite difference is obtained from a polynomial approximation, which is bound to perform significantly better than a straight line approximation. Hence, much fewer data points will be needed to obtain a closed ellipse and have the conserved quantities approach towards convergence."

    "By using adaptive step size controls, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of computations needed in the Runge-Kutta method. As described in the implementation, the parameter $\\rho$ serves as a gauge to determine whether the trajectory of the particle varies significantly between $h$ and $2h$. If it finds that the error is small, it will increase the step size and evaluate at the next step. This results in “smooth” areas being evaluated with significantly less step sizes—greatly saving computation time when compared to fixed step sizes. On the other hand, if the error is very large, the time step will be made smaller and evaluated again. This will result in more precise iterations in the areas over which the trajectory varies significantly. In other words, the adaptive step size control has the advantage of picking the time steps such that more iterations are carried out at the points in time over which the system’s change in behavior is more pronounced."

    "As discussed in my expectations, the simulations ended up behaving exactly like I expected. Indeed, for the largest step size of 10-2, we find that the error in the approximation is so large that the trajectory fails to yield an ellipse. The main cause for this is that there are not enough data points to simulate the behavior of the system properly. When the order of h is reduced to 4, we already begin to observe a change in the trajectory yielding a circular motion, but it spirals out because the linear approximations of the Euler method prevent the trajectory to return to the initial position. It is only until an order of 6 is used in h that the ellipse finally closes, meaning that at this point we obtain the “n-sided polygon” that I mentioned above.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "   In terms of the energy and angular momentum of the system, neither quantity is conserved. It is interesting to note how for both quantities the change goes like a ladder of sorts evidencing regions where the error is constant before taking a further dip. The reason behind this is that the dips occur at the points at which the trajectory of the body is changing the most, whereas the places where the change in energy and angular momentum is constant denote the parts in the trajectory where the ellipse is smooth. Once h goes like 10-6, however, it is worth noting that these errors are of order 10-3 for the energy and 10-4 for the angular momentum. If the precision of the problem is not of tremendous importance, then the Euler method can be deemed to yield a reasonable estimate for the particle’s motion at this order of h."

    "The main thing to notice this is that this method returns closed ellipses at $h = 10^{-3}$, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the required value for the Euler method. This confirms my hypothesis that, because this method uses a polynomial approximation, the incidence of error is much less pronounced. This is further confirmed by the plots denoting the change in energy and angular momentum. Except for $h = 10^{-2}$, the order of the errors is significantly smaller than what was observed for the Euler method. Indeed, at $h = 10^{-4}$ the change in energy goes like $10^{-8}$ and the change in angular momentum goes like $10^{-11}$, which I deem to be negligible fluctuations for all practical applications. This method is by far more effective than the Euler method.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "   It is of interest to note that the energy plots for the runge-kutta exhibit dips at the same places in time that the Euler method did. This supplements the possibility that error is accumulated at the places in the body’s orbit where its trajectory changes the most. Unlike the Euler method, the changes in angular momentum are positive as opposed to negative. I do not fully understand why and don’t think that it’s a simple issue of the fact that the initial angular momentum is positive—otherwise the Euler method would show the same behavior. This would be an interesting avenue of further investigation."

    "It’s impressive to notice how with delta 1e-2 you almost get a closed ellipse. The reason why I rejected this value of delta is because the initial points where the particle is at $x = 0.25$ prevent fitting the points to an ellipse. Decreasing the order of delta to 1e-3 already yields better results and at 1e-4 the closed ellipse is definite. Moreover, from the scatter plots we can discern that this adaptive method indeed does compute more iterations at the places where the trajectory is changing the most, which completely satisfies my initial expectations for this method."

    "Because the runge-kutta needs to evaluate f(R,t) four times, it results in more computations at the same order as the  Euler method. However, it yields a closed ellipse at a significantly smaller order than the Euler method, so this method is undoubtedly much faster. The magic truly happens when the adaptive method is implemented, however. The f(R,t) function is still called four times per iteration, but the rho criterion that allows the while loop to adjust at which point of t the function is next to be evaluated makes a much better use of  computation time. Indeed, this adaptive method tells the runge-kutta method to “run ahead” where the function is smooth and to “tread carefully” where there is much change in the system’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, of course, is evidenced in the scatter plot, where the density of points is higher at the extremes of the ellipse. Indeed, the best result for the adaptive method only required 1032 function calls, while the runge-kuta method needed $4000004$, which is about 103 times as many steps! The caveat here is that I haven’t looked at how the adaptive method computed energy and angular momentum. I do believe, however, that because the adaptive method has more iterations at the regions where the trajectory changes the most—the places where the dips in the energy and angular momentum plots come from for the rk4 and euler method—it should still be just as good if not better than the regular rk4 method. Extending this method to compute energy and angular momentum is almost trivial, and would be more than worth to explore.\n"
