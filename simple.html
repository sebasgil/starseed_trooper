    <p class="poem">So glad I am to be a mereological simple. My existence can thus be no more
      divided. A litle thing I am, left to be within my own space. My own hollow dot,
      my own full and sum whole. Simple in my completenes. Thus, I am  never lacking
      in substance. Truly, I am complete.
